	        GENOME ANALYSIS

Implementation of a genetic code analyzer


The purpose is to implement a set of analyses which can provide a deep
insight on the content of very large genetic codes.


First program take a file in FASTA format to prepare the data.
Split data in many files, 1 file = 1 sequence, and compress each file.
This adds pre-processing overhead but can drastically speed up the processing.
